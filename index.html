      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>Hello! I’m Mandi Lu.</p>

      <p>I’m a first-year architecture student at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, and I'm originally from Cleveland, Ohio.</p>

      <p>My interests in design ethics and architectural history have taken shape in a range of projects, from oil painting and mixed media to sculpture. Much of my work explores themes of identity and growth. I’m especially interested in how architecture can uncover hidden narratives and reveal meaningful connections. Architecture, to me, goes beyond form and function; it’s a medium for storytelling and a means of impact.</p>

      <p>In high school, I designed and painted murals for my school and several local businesses. I also had the opportunity to attend the Carnegie Mellon Pre-College Architecture Program.</p>

      <p>If you’d like to learn more or connect, feel free to get in touch!</p>
