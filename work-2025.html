      <h2>Gentle Breakage: 1/8 Model</h2>
      <p>This project addresses a common tension in urban nature spaces: while people go to parks and trails, they often remain confined to controlled paths, sidewalks, 
        and designated areas, missing the opportunity to truly engage with the natural environment. My design creates a transitional experience that encourages exploration 
        beyond these boundaries.<p> 

        <p> Located along the Three Rivers Heritage Trail near the Allegheny River in Pittsburgh, the project begins with a wooden structure that interrupts the rigid order of the sidewalk.
          Its geometric modules form an almost aggressive, wave-like shape that blocks the conventional path, guiding walkers inward while obscuring the exit. 
          This moment of uncertainty compels people to actively engage with the structure and consider the space beyond the sidewalk.</p>

        </p>Once inside, visitors encounter a concrete lattice that contrasts with the wooden entry. Its organic, fluid form has no prescribed paths, allowing for freedom of movement 
          and experimentation. The lattice guides people past a brick wall and into the overgrown woods, a space that embodies risk, discovery, and a more authentic encounter
          with nature. </p>

        </p> By creating this sequence from the controlled, predictable sidewalk to the open, explorative woods, the structure challenges passive park use. It invites visitors to 
      leave behind habitual routines, interact with the space in new ways, and immerse themselves in the richness and unpredictability of the natural world. 
      This project is not just about architecture or design; it is about creating a bridge between human order and the vitality of untamed nature,
      transforming how people experience the parks they visit.</p>

        The arched poster board imitates the form of cumulus clouds, while the spherical container (previously packaging for a toy)

      <p>I created this piece at the CMU Pre-College Architecture Program. It was derived from a pattern by Esmeralda “Es” Devlin, shown on the left.
        To maintain a consistent language with Devlin’s pattern, I incorporated similar spiraling, geometric shapes, and overlapping colors. Just as 
        the pattern’s texture remains consistent, I used consistent spiraling shapes and materials throughout. However, I used many differing colors, 
        which overlap differently depending on one's viewpoint, to imitate the discontinuities in color across the pattern’s geometric shapes. </p>

        The 3D model that this wearable was partially derived from inspired me to explore further the materiality of light in how it spills and overlaps. 
        The triangular and translucent colored plastics dapple colored light onto surrounding surfaces when near a light source. 
        The elbow and wrist joints allow for complete mobility, giving the user control over how the dapples of light move and interact. </p>

      <p>One of my favorite TED Talks is Canwen Xu’s, “I Am Not Your Asian Stereotype,” in which she discusses the gray space between familiarity and alienation that 
        Asian Americans are often grouped into. This multi-media portrait explores the ambiguity of living between two cultures, featuring an Asian-American reaching through 
        pages of Chinese and English newspapers, trying to find her way. The monochromatic colorscape creates a literal “gray space.” I used multiple layers of newspaper, 
        holding their shape with hairspray, to create this effect.

      <p>In this work, I wanted to capture a physical embodiment of the mental sensations experienced when daydreaming. Daydreaming exists 
        in a fragile balance: an escape into wandering thoughts while remaining grounded in the present moment. This relationship is expressed through 
        several visual elements. The soft brushstrokes evoke the hazy, ephemeral quality of drifting into thought, while the subject’s rigid posture and focused gaze 
        anchor the composition in reality. </p>

      <h2>Self Portrait</h2>
      <p>
        Many of my earliest childhood memories survive only as scattered fragments—sporadic moments, hazy images, and non-linear expressions suspended in time. I think it is strange 
        that some of the most foundational facets of my identity can be so deeply eroded by passing time. This piece translates that experience into a physical form, 
        using a structure that is deliberately irregular and unpredictable. Wooden dowels intersect and overlap in shifting arrangements, creating a sense of unpredictability. 
        Many of these structures frame childhood photographs that I printed onto translucent vellum paper. Their delicate opacity allows the wooden framework to dominate visually. 
        In this way, the dowels act as distortions and gaps in memory, reshaping and obscuring the images.

      <p>This piece celebrates the influence of my closest friendships and the ways they continually shape who I am. I painted the facial features of my friends onto canvases, 
        each capturing a fragment of their presence. Using steel wire, I constructed the outline of a head to function as an abstract framework that unites these separate portraits. 
        By attaching the canvases to adhesive tack and threading the wire through them, I created a figure in which each friend’s traits merge into a single form. 
        Just as these varied features come together to create one face, the many qualities of my friends intertwine to form the person I have become.</p>

        and success is never guaranteed; the process itself is as revealing as the outcome. Inspired by this, my piece captures a moment of transformation mid-explosion and is full of energy.
        The work reflects the beauty of imperfection and the tension between control and chance that emerges when materials act on their own.</p>
